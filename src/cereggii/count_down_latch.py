class CountDownLatch:

    This mimics the `java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch` class.
    Paraphrasing from Java's documentation:

    Implements a synchronization aid that allows one or more threads to wait until
    a set of operations being performed in other threads completes.

    The count starts at a given number, and threads decrement it until the count
    reaches zero, at which point waiting threads are released and any subsequent
    invocations of [`wait()`][cereggii.CountDownLatch.wait] return immediately.

    This is a one-shot phenomenon â€” the count cannot be reset.

    A CountDownLatch initialized to N can be used to make one thread wait until
    N threads have completed some action, or some action has been completed N
    times.
